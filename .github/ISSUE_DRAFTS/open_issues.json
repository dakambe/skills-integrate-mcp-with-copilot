    "body": "## Title\nAdd academy-manager features: persistence, GraphQL, dashboard, auth, UI improvements\n\n## Summary\nThis single consolidated issue requests adding a set of features inspired by the `bq-educacion/academy-manager` project to the `skills-integrate-mcp-with-copilot` repository. The goal is to grow the current simple FastAPI + static UI into a more production-ready extracurricular management platform (incrementally).\n\n## Motivation\n- Current project stores activities in-memory and provides only basic REST endpoints and a minimal static UI. Adding the features below will enable persistence, admin functionality, structured schedules, richer domain model, auth, and developer tooling.\n\n## Proposed features (combined)\n1. Persistence: replace in-memory `activities` with a database (SQLite for minimal footprint or MongoDB for parity). Add a migration strategy.\n2. GraphQL API (optional): add a GraphQL layer with schema and codegen (or keep REST and add typed OpenAPI schemas). This is optional — list as a stretch goal.\n3. Dashboard & analytics: add an admin dashboard showing aggregated counts (active activities, participants, capacity usage) and simple charts.\n4. Structured schedules & timetable editor: switch schedule strings to a structured model (days, start/end times, recurrence) and add a small JS editor to create timetables.\n5. Authentication & authorization: add JWT-based auth and optional Google OAuth for admin/teacher roles; protect admin endpoints.\n6. Multi-role frontends: scaffold (or separate) a back-office admin UI and a basic teacher UI (Next.js or keep static but modularized) — role-specific views.\n7. Shared UI components: extract and create a small component library (buttons, modals, inputs, options/multi-selects) for reuse and consistent styling.\n8. Search & filters: add server-side search, and client-side filters (multi-select OptionsBox-like control).\n9. Multi-step create/edit flows (modals): implement guided creation flows for new entities (activities, instructors, students) using modal steps and client-side validation.\n10. Domain model expansion: add `instructors` and `students` entities and connect them to activities (profiles, contact info, availability).\n11. Developer tooling & deployment: add basic pre-commit hooks (formatting/linters), Docker Compose with a DB service, and a short `README` run section.\n12. i18n/localization: add translation support (simple key-based system) with a `useTranslate`-style helper.\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- Activities persist after server restarts using a DB.\n- Admin dashboard shows aggregate counts and a basic list view of entities.\n- Users can create structured schedules and see them in the UI.\n- Signup/unregister endpoints require no changes in API contract for public signup (unless auth is enabled for admin-only actions).\n- Basic authentication protects admin pages and mutations.\n\n## Suggested implementation plan (phased)\n1. Add persistence (SQLite via `databases` or `SQLModel` / or small MongoDB compose service). Migrate `activities` to DB models and update endpoints.\n2. Add domain models for `students` and `instructors` and simple CRUD endpoints.\n3. Add dashboard endpoints (counts) and a small admin UI page to display them.\n4. Add structured schedule model and a minimal timetable component in `src/static` to edit schedules.\n5. Add JWT auth and a simple admin login; protect admin UI pages.\n6. Optional: incrementally add GraphQL or a Next.js-based admin UI and component library.\n\n## Tasks (checklist)\n- [ ] Design DB schema and choose DB (SQLite or MongoDB)\n- [ ] Implement persistence and migrations\n- [ ] Create models for students & instructors\n- [ ] Implement dashboard endpoints\n- [ ] Add schedule data model and UI editor\n- [ ] Add JWT auth and admin roles\n- [ ] Improve front-end UI components and add search/filtering\n- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks and Docker Compose\n- [ ] Add i18n support\n\n## Risks & notes\n- GraphQL + codegen is a larger change; start with REST + DB then consider GraphQL as a later migration.\n- If choosing MongoDB, include a `docker-compose.yml` DB service for local dev.\n\n## Labels (suggested)\n`enhancement`, `feature`, `backend`, `frontend`, `infra`, `medium-priority`\n\n## Assignees / Reviewers\n- (leave blank)\n\n---\n_Draft created by automation — review and edit before opening as a GitHub Issue._\n",
